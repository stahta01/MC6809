# mc6809

![mc6809](./docs/MC6809P.jpg)

## Introduction

A library written in C++ that emulates the mc6809 cpu. The enclosed ```CMakeLists.txt``` file (standard cmake procedure) will build the library and a small test application. To use this library in your project, copy the five source files from ```./src/``` into your source tree.

At this very moment, the following is not yet implemented:
* CWAI opcode
* illegal opcode exceptions (vector at $fff0)

## API

### Constructor

```cpp
mc6809::mc6809()
```

### Read and Write to Memory

Abstract class, read8 and write8 must be implemented in your subclass.

Make sure the connected memory has a functioning ROM and vector table from ```$fff0``` to ```$ffff```. Please note that an extra vector at ```$fff0``` (originally reserved by Motorola) has been added that enables handling of illegal opcodes (a feature borrowed from the Hitachi 6309).

### NMI / FIRQ / IRQ

When nothing is assigned by the hosting software, the pin states will default to high (```1``` or ```true```) internally, effectively meaning no exceptions of the above three types will happen. It is up to the programmer to supply proper connections:

```cpp
void mc6809::assign_nmi_line(bool *line)
```

```cpp
void mc6809::assign_firq_line(bool *line)
```

```cpp
void mc6809::assign_irq_line(bool *line)
```

These functions take a pointer to a boolean value (the actual line/value that represent interrupt states from the connected devices). If more devices are to be connected to one line, this must be separately programmed (see [E64](https://github.com/elmerucr/E64) source code for an example, ```exceptions_ic``` class).

### Reset

```cpp
void mc6809::reset()
```

### Execute

```cpp
uint16_t mc6809::execute()
```

Main execute function. Runs only one instruction, and returns the number of cycles consumed. Checking for breakpoints must be done with the ```mc6809::breakpoint()``` member function inbetween calls to the ```mc6809::execute()``` function. In the broadest sense, one instruction also means starting an exception (be it nmi/firq/irq).

Running more that one instruction or the ability to run ```N``` cycles has been considered but is not implemented. In most use cases we want to do nmi/firq/irq things immediately after each instruction anyway. Also checking for breakpoints becomes simpler this way.
